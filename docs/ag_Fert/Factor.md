#FACTORS AFFECTING VEGETABLE PRODUCTION

##Environmental factors
The choice of which vegetable to grow depends very much upon the environment, in particular temperature and day length.

###Temperature
Vegetables may be divided into three major groups, which are determined by their temperature requirements:
1. plants able to withstand frost at sub-zero temperatures (e.g. cabbage);
2. plants unable to withstand frosts, but able to grow at temperatures between 0° C and 20° C (e.g. potato, tomato);
3. plants requiring temperatures in excess of 10° C (e.g. melons, sweet potato).

Some vegetables, for example cauliflower, cabbage and carrots require cool temperatures if they are to provide a high quality product. This type of environment can be found at high altitude in tropical countries, although it is usual fpF-ihese areas to experience excessively high rainfall.

###Day length
Many plants require specific day length for development. A good example of this is onions, which require long days (a minimum of 12 hours of day length for 'tropical' varieties, and even longer (up to 16 hours) for temperate climate varieties in order to develop a bulb. Varieties of onion have been selected which will form bulbs with a day length of as little as 12 or 13 hours for tropical climates, but it is critical to match the variety to the latitude. For example, varieties developed for high latitude and temperate climates will not form bulbs in the tropics, whereas those selected for tropical shortday length climates will form only small bulbs prematurely, when grown at high latitude.

##Protected cultivation
Veget~bles may also be grown under protective cultivation, for example, greenhouses. This method can be expensive, but has the advantage of producing a far higher quality product, with a lower risk of pest and disease infestations and protection from heavy rains.

###Soil

####Soil type

####Soil Nutrition

##Irrigation

###Soil water relationships

###Furrow irrigation

###Drip irrigatio1l

###Overhead sprinkler irrigation


##Propagation
Vegetables are propagated (grown) either from seed or by vegetative means.

###Vegetative propagation
###Seeds
###Plant Spacing
In efficient vegetable production appropriate plant spacing is required. Plant spacing involves two distinct factors, namely:
1. plant arrangement: the spatial distribution of the plants (essentially distance between the rows);
2. plant density: the number of plants/m2•
In practice, density is much more important than plant arrangement.

##Mixed Cropping

##Plant Nutrition

##Pest and Disease Control

##GREENHOUSES

Crops have always been protected, in some manner or other, against adverse climatic conditions. Various types of walls have been constructed, as well as the use of shrubs and trees, to 'break' winds so as to protect top soil. Other methods have been used, such as collection foliage, and covering soil to protect against heavy rains, while glass has been used in an attempt to control temperature. But the use of synthetic film has created a major change, over the past three decades for protected cultivation. Smallscale farmers can protect their cultivations with plastic film that is fairly cheap, depending on type, is easy to use and manipulate and is easy to transport and distribute, hence is accessible to many. 

Film that is most commonly used for groundcover and greenhouses is Polythene (PE). Other plastic films are Polychoride (PVC), Ethyleenvinylacetate (EVA), Polyester and Tedlar. Each film type has its advantages and disadvantages. The advantages of PE, for example, is that it can be produced in all kinds of widths and thicknesses, is cheap, but has a limited durability over time. Further PE heat retention is limited, while EVA is much better and PVC is exceptionaBy good. A new develop.ment of film, Astrolux, has cooling proprieties without the need of energy supply; it can keep temperatures down by 6 to 7 ec to those of external ambient temperatures; the film though is expensive.


Importantly before any initiative is taken for protected cultivation, greenhouse, determined factors need to be considered in the project. These will have to consider the climate, the influence of the climate on the particular vegetable intended to be grown and, of course, marketing opportunities for vegetables cultivated in such a manner. In specific such factors to consider are:

###Rainfall. 
###Temperatures.
###Sunshine.
###Air humidity.
###Wind.
###Evaporation.
###Soil.
###Water.
###Topography.
###Accessibility to the protected cultivation area.
###Transport.
###Marketing.
###Improved yields and costs.
###Association.

###Greenhouse Types

###Climate Control

###Greenhouse Pest Control

###Irrigating Greenhouse Vegetables

###Producticn Management

###Investment and Costs
